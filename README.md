# Bikesharing

## Overview
In this project, we are asked to use Tableau to find out if a bike rental business is worth investing for a different ciy. 

## Analysis 
First, I needed to make a change in the csv file so that trip duration was in hours and minutes. 
Then, I uploaded the new CSV into tableau with the converted tripduration column.
Finally, I wanted to find out how long trips were in August, as tripurdation plays an important factor in this analysis. This gave me a good understanding of how long bikes were rented, when they were rented, and what popular times they were rented. 

## Results
I was able to make 7 different visulizations in Tableau. Here were my results:
- In the month of August, there were 2.3 million rides.
- 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.
- Men had the most individuals.

- Males take up most of the trips.

## Summary
During the month of August in 2019, there was a high amount of activity for the bike sharing service. Most of the rides were from males in monrings, evenings, and on weekends. 
Some more visualizations can be done.
